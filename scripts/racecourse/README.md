# racecourse

The script basically fetches train timings for:

* Shatin
* University

and then filters them for `UP` / `DOWN` + the `RAC` route specifically and logs it.

This can be used to later analyze all the timings to try and guesstimate station opening times, or at the very least first / last train timings.
